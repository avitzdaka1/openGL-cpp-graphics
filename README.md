# openGL-cpp-repo
Self-Study OpenGL project.


- Purposes: Learning the following: <br/>
  * rendering
  * shaders
  * mapping
  * 3d graphics
  * camera manipulation ("a,w,s,d" for x,z - axis movement, "e,q" for turning, "x,c" for y-axis movement)
  * shadows and some other effects
  
 A helper project to easily convert .obj files to my custom format is located at https://github.com/maksimlya/ObjToMyobj

Simply open with visual studio(tested on 2017) with c++ installed (might need to copy glew32.dll into build directory).
